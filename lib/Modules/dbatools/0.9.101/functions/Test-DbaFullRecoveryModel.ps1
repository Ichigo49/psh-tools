function Test-DbaFullRecoveryModel {
	<#
		.SYNOPSIS
			Find if database is really in the Full recovery model or not.

		.DESCRIPTION
			When you switch a database into FULL recovery model, it will behave like a SIMPLE recovery model until a full backup is taken in order to begin a log backup chain. This state is also known as 'pseudo-Simple'.

			Inspired by Paul Randal's post (http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/new-script-is-that-database-really-in-the-full-recovery-mode/)

 		.PARAMETER SqlInstance
			The SQL Server instance to connect to.

        .PARAMETER SqlCredential
			Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins instead of Windows Authentication (AKA Integrated or Trusted). To use:

			$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SqlCredential parameter.

			Windows Authentication will be used if SqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials.

			To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

		.PARAMETER Database
			Specifies the database(s) to process. Options for this list are auto-populated from the server. If unspecified, all databases will be processed.

		.PARAMETER ExcludeDatabase
			Specifies the database(s) to exclude from processing. Options for this list are auto-populated from the server.

		.PARAMETER Detailed
			If this switch is enabled, an additional "Notes" column is returned in the results.

		.EXAMPLE
			Test-DbaFullRecoveryModel -SqlInstance sql2005

			Shows all databases where the configured recovery model is FULL and indicates whether or not they are really in FULL recovery model.

		.EXAMPLE
			Test-DbaFullRecoveryModel -SqlInstance . | Where-Object {$_.ActualRecoveryModel -ne "FULL"}

			Only shows the databases that are in 'pseudo-simple' mode.

		.EXAMPLE
			Test-DbaFullRecoveryModel -SqlInstance sql2008 | Sort-Object Server, ActualRecoveryModel -Descending

			Shows all databases where the configured recovery model is FULL and indicates whether or not they are really in FULL recovery model. The Sort-Object will cause the databases in 'pseudo-simple' mode to show first.
