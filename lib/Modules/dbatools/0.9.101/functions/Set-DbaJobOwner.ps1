function Set-DbaJobOwner {
	<#
		.SYNOPSIS
			Sets SQL Agent job owners with a desired login if jobs do not match that owner.

		.DESCRIPTION
			This function alters SQL Agent Job ownership to match a specified login if their current owner does not match the target login. By default, the target login will be 'sa', but the the user may specify a different login for ownership. This be applied to all jobs or only to a select collection of jobs.

		.PARAMETER SqlInstance 
			Specifies the SQL Server instance(s) to scan.
			
		.PARAMETER SqlCredential
			Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins instead of Windows Authentication (AKA Integrated or Trusted). To use:

			$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SqlCredential parameter.

			Windows Authentication will be used if SqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials.

			To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

		.PARAMETER Job 
			Specifies the job(s) to process. Options for this list are auto-populated from the server. If unspecified, all jobs will be processed.
		
		.PARAMETER ExcludeJob
			Specifies the job(s) to exclude from processing. Options for this list are auto-populated from the server.
		
		.PARAMETER Login
			Specifies the login that you wish check for ownership. This defaults to 'sa' or the sysadmin name if sa was renamed. This must be a valid security principal which exists on the target server.

		.PARAMETER WhatIf
			If this switch is enabled, no actions are performed but informational messages will be displayed that explain what would happen if the command were to run.

		.PARAMETER Confirm
			If this switch is enabled, you will be prompted for confirmation before executing any operations that change state.

		.PARAMETER EnableException
			By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
			This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
			Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.

		.EXAMPLE
			Set-DbaJobOwner -SqlInstance localhost

			Sets SQL Agent Job owner to sa on all jobs where the owner does not match sa.

		.EXAMPLE
			Set-DbaJobOwner -SqlInstance localhost -Login DOMAIN\account

			Sets SQL Agent Job owner to sa on all jobs where the owner does not match 'DOMAIN\account'. Note
			that Login must be a valid security principal that exists on the target server.

		.EXAMPLE
			Set-DbaJobOwner -SqlInstance localhost -Job job1, job2

			Sets SQL Agent Job owner to 'sa' on the job1 and job2 jobs if their current owner does not match 'sa'.

		.EXAMPLE
			'sqlserver','sql2016' | Set-DbaJobOwner

			Sets SQL Agent Job owner to sa on all jobs where the owner does not match sa on both sqlserver and sql2016.
