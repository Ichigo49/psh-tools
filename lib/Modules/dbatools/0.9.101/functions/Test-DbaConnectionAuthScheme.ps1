function Test-DbaConnectionAuthScheme {
	<#
		.SYNOPSIS
			Returns the transport protocol and authentication scheme of the connection. This is useful to determine if your connection is using Kerberos.
			
		.DESCRIPTION
			By default, this command will return the ConnectName, ServerName, Transport and AuthScheme of the current connection.
			
			ConnectName is the name you used to connect. ServerName is the name that the SQL Server reports as its @@SERVERNAME which is used to register its SPN. If you were expecting a Kerberos connection and got NTLM instead, ensure ConnectName and ServerName match. 

			If -Kerberos or -Ntlm is specified, the $true/$false results of the test will be returned. Returns $true or $false by default for one server. Returns Server name and Results for more than one server.
			
		.PARAMETER SqlInstance
			The SQL Server that you're connecting to. Server(s) must be SQL Server 2005 or higher.
			
		.PARAMETER Kerberos
			If this switch is enabled, checks will be made for Kerberos authentication.

		.PARAMETER Ntlm
			If this switch is enabled, checks will be made for NTLM authentication.
			
		.PARAMETER Detailed
			If this switch is enabled, a detailed list of authentication schemes and transport methods in use will be returned.

		.PARAMETER SqlCredential 
			Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins instead of Windows Authentication (AKA Integrated or Trusted). To use:

			$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SqlCredential parameter.

			Windows Authentication will be used if SqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials.

			To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

			.PARAMETER EnableException
			By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
			This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
			Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
