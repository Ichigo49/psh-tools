function Repair-DbaServerName {
	<#
		.SYNOPSIS
			Renames @@SERVERNAME to match with the Windows name.
			
		.DESCRIPTION
			When a SQL Server's host OS is renamed, the SQL Server should be as well. This helps with Availability Groups and Kerberos.

			This command renames @@SERVERNAME to match with the Windows name. The new name is automatically determined. It does not matter if you use an alias to connect to the SQL instance.
					
			If the automatically determined new name matches the old name, the command will not run.

		.PARAMETER SqlInstance
			The SQL Server that you're connecting to.

		.PARAMETER Credential
			Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins instead of Windows Authentication (AKA Integrated or Trusted). To use:

			$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -Credential parameter.

			Windows Authentication will be used if Credential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials.

			To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

		.PARAMETER AutoFix
			If this switch is enabled, the repair will be performed automatically.

		.PARAMETER Force
			If this switch is enabled, most confirmation prompts will be skipped.

		.PARAMETER WhatIf
			If this switch is enabled, no actions are performed but informational messages will be displayed that explain what would happen if the command were to run.

		.PARAMETER Confirm
			If this switch is enabled, you will be prompted for confirmation before executing any operations that change state.

		.EXAMPLE
			Repair-DbaServerName -SqlInstance sql2014

			Checks to see if the server name is updatable and changes the name with a number of prompts.

		.EXAMPLE
			Repair-DbaServerName -SqlInstance sql2014 -AutoFix

			Checks to see if the server name is updatable and automatically performs the change. Replication or mirroring will be broken if necessary.

		.EXAMPLE   
			Repair-DbaServerName -SqlInstance sql2014 -AutoFix -Force
				
			Checks to see if the server name is updatable and automatically performs the change, bypassing most prompts and confirmations. Replication or mirroring will be broken if necessary.
