function Get-DbaDbMailHistory {
<#
	.SYNOPSIS
		Gets the history of mail sent from a SQL instance
	
	.DESCRIPTION
		Gets the history of mail sent from a SQL instance
	
	.PARAMETER SqlInstance
		The SQL Server instance, or instances.
	
	.PARAMETER SqlCredential
		Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted.

	.PARAMETER Since
	Datetime object used to narrow the results to the send request date
	
	.PARAMETER Status
	Narrow the results by status. Valid values include Unsent, Sent, Failed and Retrying
	
	.PARAMETER EnableException 
		By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
		This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
		Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
