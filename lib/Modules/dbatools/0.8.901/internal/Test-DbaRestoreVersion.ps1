function Test-DbaRestoreVersion
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS 
Checks that the restore files are from a version of SQL Server that can be restored on the target version

.DESCRIPTION
Finds the anchoring Full backup (or multiple if it's a striped set).
Then filters to ensure that all the backups are from that anchor point (LastLSN) and that they're all on the same RecoveryForkID
Then checks that we have either enough Diffs and T-log backups to get to where we want to go. And checks that there is no break between
LastLSN and FirstLSN in sequential files
	
.PARAMETER FilterdRestoreFiles
This is just an object consisting of the output from Read-DbaBackupHeader. Normally this will have been filtered down to a restorable chain 
before arriving here. (ie; only 1 anchoring Full backup)

.PARAMETER SqlServer
Sql Server Instance against which the restore is going to be performed

.PARAMETER SqlCredential
Credential for connectin to SqlServer
