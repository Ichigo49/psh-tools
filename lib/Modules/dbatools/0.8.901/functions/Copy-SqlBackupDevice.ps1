Function Copy-SqlBackupDevice
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Copies backup devices one by one. Copies both SQL code and the backup file itself.

.DESCRIPTION
Backups are migrated using Admin shares.  If destination directory does not exist, SQL Server's default backup directory will be used.

If backup device with same name exists on destination, it will not be dropped and recreated unless -Force is used.

THIS CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES.

.PARAMETER Source
Source SQL Server.You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER Destination
Destination Sql Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER SourceSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SourceSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER DestinationSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$dcred = Get-Credential, then pass this $dcred to the -DestinationSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command. 

.PARAMETER Force
Drops and recreates the backup device if it exists

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlBackupDevice -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster

Copies all server backup devices from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using Windows credentials. If backup devices with the same name exist on sqlcluster, they will be skipped.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlBackupDevice -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -BackupDevices backup01 -SourceSqlCredential $cred -Force

Copies a single backup device, backup01, from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using SQL credentials for sqlserver2014a
and Windows credentials for sqlcluster. If a backup device with the same name exists on sqlcluster, it will be dropped and recreated because -Force was used.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlBackupDevice -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -WhatIf -Force

Shows what would happen if the command were executed using force.
