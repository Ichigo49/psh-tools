Function Copy-SqlSharedSchedule
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS 
Copy-SqlSharedSchedule migrates shared job schedules from one SQL Server to another. 

.DESCRIPTION
By default, all shared job schedules are copied. The -SharedSchedules parameter is autopopulated for command-line completion and can be used to copy only specific shared job schedules.

If the associated credential for the account does not exist on the destination, it will be skipped. If the shared job schedule already exists on the destination, it will be skipped unless -Force is used.  

.PARAMETER Source
Source SQL Server.You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER Destination
Destination Sql Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER SourceSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SourceSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER DestinationSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$dcred = Get-Credential, then pass this $dcred to the -DestinationSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command. 

.PARAMETER Force
Drops and recreates the schedule if it exists

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlSharedSchedule -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster

Copies all shared job schedules from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using Windows credentials. If shared job schedules with the same name exist on sqlcluster, they will be skipped.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlSharedSchedule -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -SharedSchedule Weekly -SourceSqlCredential $cred -Force

Copies a single shared job schedule, the Weekly shared job schedule from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using SQL credentials for sqlserver2014a and Windows credentials for sqlcluster. If a shared job schedule with the same name exists on sqlcluster, it will be dropped and recreated because -Force was used.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlSharedSchedule -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -WhatIf -Force

Shows what would happen if the command were executed using force.
