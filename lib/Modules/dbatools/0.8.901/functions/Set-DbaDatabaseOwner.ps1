function Set-DbaDatabaseOwner
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Sets database owners with a desired login if databases do not match that owner.

.DESCRIPTION
This function will alter database ownershipt to match a specified login if their current owner does not match the target login. By default, the target login will be 'sa', but the fuction will allow the user to specify a different login for  ownership. The user can also apply this to all databases or only to a select list of databases (passed as either a comma separated list or a string array).
