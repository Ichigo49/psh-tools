Function Get-DbaMaxMemory
{
<# 
.SYNOPSIS 
Gets the 'Max Server Memory' configuration setting and the memory of the server.  Works on SQL Server 2000-2014.

.DESCRIPTION 
This command retrieves the SQL Server 'Max Server Memory' configuration setting as well as the total  physical installed on the server.

.PARAMETER SqlServer
Allows you to specify a comma separated list of servers to query.

.PARAMETER SqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$cred = Get-Credential, then pass $cred variable to this parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used when SqlCredential is not specified. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.
