{
<# 
.SYNOPSIS 
Displays information relating to SQL Server Optimize for AdHoc Workloads setting.  Works on SQL Server 2008-2016.

.DESCRIPTION 
When this option is set, plan cache size is further reduced for single-use adhoc OLTP workload.

http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/glennberry/2011/02/25/some-suggested-sql-server-2008-r2-instance-configuration-settings/

These are just general recommendations for SQL Server and are a good starting point for setting the "optimize for adhoc workloads" option.

.PARAMETER SqlServer
Allows you to specify a comma separated list of servers to query.

.PARAMETER SqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:
$cred = Get-Credential, this pass this $cred to the param. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.
