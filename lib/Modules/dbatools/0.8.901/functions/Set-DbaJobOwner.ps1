function Set-DbaJobOwner
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Sets SQL Agent job owners with a desired login if jobs do not match that owner.

.DESCRIPTION
This function will alter SQL Agent Job ownership to match a specified login if their
current owner does not match the target login. By default, the target login will
be 'sa', but the fuction will allow the user to specify a different login for 
ownership. The user can also apply this to all jobs or only to a select list
of jobs (passed as either a comma separated list or a string array).
