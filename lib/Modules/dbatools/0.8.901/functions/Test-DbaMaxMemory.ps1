Function Test-DbaMaxMemory
{
<# 
.SYNOPSIS 
Calculates the recommended value for SQL Server 'Max Server Memory' configuration setting. Works on SQL Server 2000-2014.

.DESCRIPTION 
Inspired by Jonathan Kehayias's post about SQL Server Max memory (http://bit.ly/sqlmemcalc), this script displays a SQL Server's: 
total memory, currently configured SQL max memory, and the calculated recommendation.

Jonathan notes that the formula used provides a *general recommendation* that doesn't account for everything that may be going on in your specific environment. 

.PARAMETER SqlServer
Allows you to specify a comma separated list of servers to query.

.PARAMETER SqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$cred = Get-Credential, then pass $cred variable to this parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used when SqlCredential is not specified. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.EXAMPLE   
Test-DbaMaxMemory -SqlServer sqlcluster,sqlserver2012

Calculate the 'Max Server Memory' settings for all servers within the SQL Server Central Management Server "sqlcluster"

.EXAMPLE 
Test-DbaMaxMemory -SqlServer sqlcluster | Where-Object { $_.SqlMaxMB -gt $_.TotalMB } | Set-DbaMaxMemory 

Find all servers in CMS that have Max SQL memory set to higher than the total memory of the server (think 2147483647) and set it to recommended value.
