Function Copy-SqlDatabaseAssembly
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS 
Copy-SqlDatabaseAssembly migrates assemblies from one SQL Server to another. 

.DESCRIPTION
By default, all assemblies are copied. The -Assemblies parameter is autopopulated for command-line completion and can be used to copy only specific assemblies.

If the assembly already exists on the destination, it will be skipped unless -Force is used. 
	
This script does not yet copy dependents.

.PARAMETER Source
Source SQL Server.You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER Destination
Destination Sql Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER SourceSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SourceSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER DestinationSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$dcred = Get-Credential, then pass this $dcred to the -DestinationSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command. 

.PARAMETER Force
Drops and recreates the XXXXX if it exists

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlDatabaseAssembly -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster

Copies all assemblies from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using Windows credentials. If assemblies with the same name exist on sqlcluster, they will be skipped.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlDatabaseAssembly -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -Assemblies dbname.assemblyname, dbname3.anotherassembly -SourceSqlCredential $cred -Force

Copies two assemblies, the dbname.assemblyname and dbname3.anotherassembly, from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using SQL credentials for sqlserver2014a and Windows credentials for sqlcluster. If a assembly with the same name exists on sqlcluster, it will be dropped and recreated because -Force was used.
	
In this example, anotherassembly will be copied to the dbname3 database on the server "sqlcluster".
	
.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlThing -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -WhatIf -Force

Shows what would happen if the command were executed using force.
