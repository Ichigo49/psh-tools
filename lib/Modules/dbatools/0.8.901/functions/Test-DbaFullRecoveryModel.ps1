Function Test-DbaFullRecoveryModel
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Find if database is really in the Full recovery model or not.

.DESCRIPTION
When you switch a database into FULL recovery model, it will behave like a SIMPLE recovery model until a full backup is taken in order to begin a log backup chain.
This state is also known as 'pseudo-Simple'.

Inspired by Paul Randal's post (http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/new-script-is-that-database-really-in-the-full-recovery-mode/)
	
.PARAMETER SqlServer
The SQL Server instance.

.PARAMETER SqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if SqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER Detailed
Returns default information plus 'Notes' column

.EXAMPLE
Test-DbaFullRecoveryModel -SqlServer sql2005

Shows all databases which actual configured recovery model is FULL and says if they are really in FULL recovery model or not

.EXAMPLE
Test-DbaFullRecoveryModel -SqlServer . | Where-Object {$_.ActualRecoveryModel -ne "FULL"}

Only shows the databases that are in 'pseudo-simple' mode.
	
.EXAMPLE   
Test-DbaFullRecoveryModel -SqlServer sql2008 | Sort-Object Server, ActualRecoveryModel -Descending
	
Shows all databases which actual configured recovery model is FULL and says if they are really in FULL recovery model or not. Will show in first place the ones that are in 'pseudo-simple' mode.
