Function Repair-DbaServerName
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Renames @@SERVERNAME to match with the Windows name.
	
.DESCRIPTION
When a SQL Server's host OS is renamed, the SQL Server should be as well. This helps with Availability Groups and Kerberos.

This command renames @@SERVERNAME to match with the Windows name. The new name is automatically determined. It does not matter if you use an alias to connect to the SQL instance.
		
If the automatically determiend new name matches the old name, the command will not run.

.PARAMETER SqlServer
The SQL Server that you're connecting to.

.PARAMETER Credential
Credential object used to connect to the SQL Server as a different user.

.PARAMETER Detailed
Specifies if the servername is updatable. If updatable -eq $false, it will return the reasons why.

.PARAMETER Force
By default, this command produces a ton of confirm prompts. Force bypasses many of these confirms, but not all.

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command. 

.PARAMETER AutoFix
Automatically performs the fix

.EXAMPLE
Repair-DbaServerName -SqlServer sql2014

Checks to see if the server is updatable, prompts galore, changes name.

.EXAMPLE
Repair-DbaServerName -SqlServer sql2014 -AutoFix

Even more prompts/confirms, but removes Replication or breaks mirroring if necessary.

.EXAMPLE   
Repair-DbaServerName -SqlServer sql2014 -AutoFix -Force
	
Skips some prompts/confirms but not all of them.
