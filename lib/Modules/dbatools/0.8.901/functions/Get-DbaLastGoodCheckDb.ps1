Function Get-DbaLastGoodCheckDb
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get date/time for last known good DBCC CHECKDB

.DESCRIPTION
Retrieves and compares the date/time for the last known good DBCC CHECKDB, as well as the creation date/time for the database.

This function supports SQL Server 2005+

Please note that this script uses the DBCC DBINFO() WITH TABLERESULTS. DBCC DBINFO has several known weak points, such as:
 - DBCC DBINFO is an undocumented feature/command.
 - The LastKnowGood timestamp is updated when a DBCC CHECKFILEGROUP is performed.
 - The LastKnowGood timestamp is updated when a DBCC CHECKDB WITH PHYSICAL_ONLY is performed.
 - The LastKnowGood timestamp does not get updated when a database in READ_ONLY.

An empty ($null) LastGoodCheckDb result indicates that a good DBCC CHECKDB has never been performed.

SQL Server 2008R2 has a "bug" that causes each databases to possess two dbi_dbccLastKnownGood fields, instead of the normal one.
This script will only displaythis function to only display the newest timestamp. If -Verbose is specified, the function will announce every time more than one dbi_dbccLastKnownGood fields is encountered.
