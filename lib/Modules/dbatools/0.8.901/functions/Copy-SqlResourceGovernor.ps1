Function Copy-SqlResourceGovernor
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Migrates Resource Pools

.DESCRIPTION
By default, all non-system resource pools are migrated. If the pool already exists on the destination, it will be skipped unless -Force is used. 
	
The -ResourcePools parameter is autopopulated for command-line completion and can be used to copy only specific objects.

THIS CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES.

.PARAMETER Source
Source SQL Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2008 or higher.

.PARAMETER Destination
Destination Sql Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2008 or higher.

.PARAMETER SourceSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SourceSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER DestinationSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$dcred = Get-Credential, then pass this $dcred to the -DestinationSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER Force
If policies exists on destination server, it will be dropped and recreated.

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command.
