Function Get-DbaDetachedDatabaseInfo
{
<#  
.SYNOPSIS  
Get detailed information about detached SQL Server database files.

.DESCRIPTION
This script gathers the following information from detached database files: database name, SQL Server version (compatibility level), collation, and file structure. 
	
"Data files" and "Log file" report the structure of the data and log files as they were when the database was detached. "Database version" is the comptability level.

MDF files are most easily read by using a SQL Server to interpret them. Because of this, you must specify a SQL Server and the path must be relative to the SQL Server.

.PARAMETER SqlServer
An online SQL Server is required to parse the information within the detached database file. Note that this script will not attach the file, it will simply use SQL Server to read its contents.
 
.PARAMETER Path 
The path to the MDF file. This path must be readable by the SQL Server service account. Ideally, the MDF will be located on the SQL Server itself, or on a network share to which the SQL Server service account has access. 

.PARAMETER SqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$cred = Get-Credential, this pass this $cred to the SqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if SqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.EXAMPLE    
Get-DbaDetachedDatabaseInfo -SqlServer sql2016 -Path M:\Archive\mydb.mdf
	
SQL Server is required to process offilne MDF files. The abvoe example reutrns information about the detached database file, M:\Archive\mydb.mdf. This path is relative to the SQL Server "sql2016".
