Function Copy-SqlCustomError
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS 
Copy-SqlCustomError migrates custom errors (user defined messages) from one SQL Server to another. 

.DESCRIPTION
By default, all  custom errors are copied. The -CustomErrors parameter is autopopulated for command-line completion and can be used to copy only specific custom errors.

If the custom error already exists on the destination, it will be skipped unless -Force is used. Interesting fact, if you drop the us_english version, all the other languages will be dropped for that specific ID as well.

Also, the us_english version must be created first.
	
.PARAMETER Source
Source SQL Server.You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER Destination
Destination Sql Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER SourceSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SourceSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER DestinationSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$dcred = Get-Credential, then pass this $dcred to the -DestinationSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command. 

.PARAMETER Force
Drops and recreates the XXXXX if it exists

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlCustomError -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster

Copies all server custom errors from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using Windows credentials. If custom errors with the same name exist on sqlcluster, they will be skipped.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlCustomError -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -Trigger 60000 -SourceSqlCredential $cred -Force

Copies a single custom error, the custom error with ID number 6000 from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using SQL credentials for sqlserver2014a and Windows credentials for sqlcluster. If a custom error with the same name exists on sqlcluster, it will be updated because -Force was used.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlCustomError -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -WhatIf -Force

Shows what would happen if the command were executed using force.
