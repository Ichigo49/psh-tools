Function Copy-SqlOperator
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS 
Copy-SqlOperator migrates operators from one SQL Server to another. 

.DESCRIPTION
By default, all operators are copied. The -Operators parameter is autopopulated for command-line completion and can be used to copy only specific operators.

If the associated credentials for the operator do not exist on the destination, it will be skipped. If the operator already exists on the destination, it will be skipped unless -Force is used.  

.PARAMETER Source
Source SQL Server.You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER Destination
Destination Sql Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER SourceSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SourceSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	
To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER DestinationSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$dcred = Get-Credential, then pass this $dcred to the -DestinationSqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. 	

To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command. 

.PARAMETER Force
Drops and recreates the Operator if it exists

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlOperator -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster

Copies all operators from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using Windows credentials. If operators with the same name exist on sqlcluster, they will be skipped.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlOperator -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -Operator PSOperator -SourceSqlCredential $cred -Force

Copies a single operator, the PSOperator operator from sqlserver2014a to sqlcluster, using SQL credentials for sqlserver2014a and Windows credentials for sqlcluster. If an operator with the same name exists on sqlcluster, it will be dropped and recreated because -Force was used.

.EXAMPLE   
Copy-SqlOperator -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -WhatIf -Force

Shows what would happen if the command were executed using force.
