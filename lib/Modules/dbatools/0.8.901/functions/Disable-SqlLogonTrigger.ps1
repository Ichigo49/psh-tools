Function Disable-SqlLogonTrigger
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS


.DESCRIPTION

	
.PARAMETER SqlServer
The SQL Server instance. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or higher.

.PARAMETER SqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SqlCredential parameter. 

Windows Authentication will be used if SqlCredential is not specified. SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER TriggerName
The name of a specific logon trigger to disable.

.PARAMETER DisableAll
Disable all logon triggers not shipped by Microsoft.
