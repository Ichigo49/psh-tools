Function Get-DbaRoleMember
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get members of all roles on a Sql instance.

.DESCRIPTION
Get members of all roles on a Sql instance.

Default output includes columns SQLServer, Database, Role, Member.

.PARAMETER SQLInstance
The SQL Server that you're connecting to.

.PARAMETER SqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, then pass $scred object to the -SqlCredential parameter. 

SQL Server does not accept Windows credentials being passed as credentials. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.PARAMETER IncludeServerLevel
Shows also information on Server Level Permissions.

.PARAMETER NoFixedRole
Excludes all members of fixed roles.

.PARAMETER Credential
Credential object used to connect to the SQL Server as a different user.
