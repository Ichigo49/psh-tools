Function Test-SqlMigrationConstraint
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Show if you can migrate the database(s) between the servers.

.DESCRIPTION
When you want to migrate from a higher edition to a lower one there are some features that can't be used.
This function will validate if you have any of this features in use and will report to you.
The validation will be made ONLY on on SQL Server 2008 or higher using the 'sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features' dmv.

This function only validate SQL Server 2008 versions or higher.
The editions supported by this function are:
    - Enterprise
    - Developer
    - Evaluation
    - Standard
    - Express

Take into account the new features introduced on SQL Server 2016 SP1 for all versions. More information at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlreleaseservices/sql-server-2016-service-pack-1-sp1-released/
	
The -Databases parameter is autopopulated for command-line completion.

.PARAMETER Source
Source SQL Server.You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER Destination
Destination Sql Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER SourceSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command. 

$scred = Get-Credential, this pass $scred object to the param. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.	

.PARAMETER DestinationSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$dcred = Get-Credential, this pass this $dcred to the param. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.

.EXAMPLE
Test-SqlMigrationConstraint -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster

Description

All databases will be verified for features in use that can't be supported on the destination server


.EXAMPLE   
Test-SqlMigrationConstraint -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -SqlCredential $cred

Description

All databases will be verified for features in use that can't be supported on the destination server using SQL credentials for sqlserver2014a
and Windows credentials for sqlcluster.

.EXAMPLE   
Test-SqlMigrationConstraint -Source sqlserver2014a -Destination sqlcluster -Databases db1
Only db1 database will be verified for features in use that can't be supported on the destination server
