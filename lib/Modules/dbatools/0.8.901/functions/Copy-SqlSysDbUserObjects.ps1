Function Copy-SqlSysDbUserObjects
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Imports *all* user objects found in source SQL Server's master, msdb and model databases to the destination.

.DESCRIPTION
Imports *all* user objects found in source SQL Server's master, msdb and model databases to the destination. This is useful because many DBA's store backup/maintenance procs/tables/triggers/etc (among other things) in master or msdb.

It is also useful for migrating objects within the model database.

.PARAMETER Source
Source SQL Server.You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER Destination
Destination SQL Server. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

.PARAMETER SourceSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$scred = Get-Credential, this pass $scred object to the param. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.	

.PARAMETER DestinationSqlCredential
Allows you to login to servers using SQL Logins as opposed to Windows Auth/Integrated/Trusted. To use:

$dcred = Get-Credential, this pass this $dcred to the param. 

Windows Authentication will be used if DestinationSqlCredential is not specified. To connect as a different Windows user, run PowerShell as that user.	

.PARAMETER WhatIf 
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed. 

.PARAMETER Confirm 
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command. 

.EXAMPLE
Copy-SqlSysDbUserObjects $sourceserver $destserver
	
Copies user objects from source to destination
