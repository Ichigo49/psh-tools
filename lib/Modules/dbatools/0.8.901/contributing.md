## Adding new commands and features

* **This is how we like people to add new commands**
<br><br>New command proposals must be approved by Chrissy LeMaire, the original creator of dbatools. This ensures the proposed command aligns with the intended spirit of the toolset. You can message Chrissy on [Slack](https://dbatools.io/slack) (@ctrlb) or post your proposal on the [Trello](https://dbatools.io/trello) Ideas list.<br><br>Check out the Ideas list on our [Trello board](https://dbatools.io/trello) to get a feel for the types of commands we like. Also take a look at [Microsoft's SqlServer Trello board](https://sqlps.io/vote) to see the commands that are more appropriate for the official SQL Server PowerShell module (and vote while you're there!)

* **Here are some specifics on the coding style we prefer**
<br><br>This will be available on the Wiki shortly. Until then, please look inside the .ps1 files or the [dbatools-templates](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools-templates) repository.

* **This is how you send your pull request**
<br><br>This information will also be available on the Wiki as as step-by-step. The most important thing to note is that all pull requests must be made into the **development** branch. We only push to the master branch once a month.

* **You should include the following documentation**
<br><br>Please look at the available [dbatools-templates](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools-templates) to see the kind of documentation we're looking for (basically everything that PowerShell allows - SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, PARAMETERS, NOTES, EXAMPLES and so on.
        
* **You should include the following tests**
<br><br>Please include at least 3 Examples in your command's documentation section. We use these to perform our tests. You can also look at [this awesome Pull Request comment](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools/pull/254#issuecomment-253355070) that has step-by-step tests and expected outcomes for our QA team.

# Bug triage

This sections explains how bug triaging is done for our project.

* You can help us diagnose and fix existing bugs by asking and providing answers for the following:
  * Is the bug reproducible as explained?   
  * Is it reproducible in other environments (for instance, on different browsers or devices)?   
  * Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?  
  * What tags should the bug have?  
  * Is this bug something you have run into? Would you appreciate it being looked into faster? 


# Beta testing

Early releases require heavy testing and how they can help with specially across different versions, editions and environments.

* For our project you will be able to find the roadmap and features that require
testing on the wiki (but it's not there yet).

# Translations

* You can help us translate our project by submitting a PR with the translation. We hope to add localization to the project by version 1.0

# Documentation

Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have trouble explaining it to someone just getting into it. 

* Help us with documentation by modifying the command's Help section and submitting a Pull Request. You can also message @ctrlb on Slack with modifications for the [documentation on the dbatools website](https://dbatools.io/commands).

# Community 
This section includes ideas on how non-developers can help with the project.

* You can help us answer questions our users have on [Slack](https://dbatools.io/slack)
* You can help design the commands so that they solve your problems in a [Github Issue](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools/issues)
* You can help write blog posts about dbatools
* You can help create videos and we'll put them on our [YouTube channel](https://dbatools.io/youtube)
